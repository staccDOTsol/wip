# Dispenser

This dispenser program allows swapping a token (e.g. SOL) for another token held in a vault (e.g. DCT) at a predefined rate.

The goal of this program in the context of the [dRaffle Luck Club](https://www.draffle.io/) is to allow early adopters to participate in specific Raffles for free, while simultaneously allowing standard paid entry. Specifically, this is done by setting the ticket price in dRaffle Community Token a.k.a DCT, which were airdropped to early adopters, while making use of a X -> DCT dispenser to allow payements in X (e.g. SOL) from the dApp.

- Registry: Defines a token vault, an admin, a token pair, and a rate.
